# READ ME Generator 

  ## Description

  Using Node.js and Inquirer, two javascript files were created, one two prompt users to answer questions about their readme and another to build the template that will be populated with those answers using ES6. After running the command "node index.js" in the command line, users will be prompted to answer questions about their project and upon completion those answers will populate in a new file that they can then use as their read me for their project. This project is useful for others and for myself because I can use this in future projects to create polished and complete readme's that have all the information that people viewing my projects would need to make use of them. I found linking the two javascript files properly to be quite challenging in this project but after some help from classmates I was able to do this. I look forward to using this extensively in other projects.

  The sample readme in this repository has information that a video linked below made. This readme was also created by the generator.
